MakingAnMCMod
=============
Hello! This is going to be a little experiment to try to learn Java and make a mod. I've had no real experience with a high-level programming language like Java nor with things like Git(Hub) and an IDE. I'm going to be following along to Pahimar's Let's Mod Reboot series.
